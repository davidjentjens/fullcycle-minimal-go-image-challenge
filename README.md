# fullcycle-minimal-go-image-challenge
 This repository contains my submission for the Full Cycle course Go challenge. The challenge was to create a minimal Go docker image (less than 2MB) which prints out the string "Full Cycle Rocks!!" to the console. This was achieved using multi-stage building and minimal docker base images.
